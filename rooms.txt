It's too dark to see, but flashes of lightning outside the window throw occasional flashes of brilliance against the walls that illuminate recognizable shapes, a chair here, the toy chest there, the corkboard on the wall where you hang all the pictures you draw in Mrs. Kline's second grade class...:south=UpstairsHallway:bed=It's your bed. The bedsheets have cartoon dinosaurs on them, characters from your favorite TV series "Dinocopters."

Above your head, you can see the outline of the trapdoor that leads to the attic.:west=JamiesRoom,east=Nursery:trapdoor=It's a trapdoor set into the ceiling that leads to the attic. You could open it if you could reach the dangling pull string.=static|pull string=The pull string is out of reach.=static
